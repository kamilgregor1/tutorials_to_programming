# GENERAL

## Every command in SQL is terminated with ';'
## SQL is not case sensitive, it's a custom to write reserved words (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) in all caps
## SQL is not space and paragraph break sensitive, it's a custom to start every clause of a statement on a new line
## In SQL, order of clauses in a statements matters (e.g. in SELECT, GROUP BY must follow after WHERE)

## SQL data is stored on a server, if data is loaded from an external source, input files must be located on the server
## When using a local server, it's possible to load data located in a dedicated folder (usually "C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.7/Uploads/"). This folder cannot be changed dynamically and is specified in the my.ini file

## '*' stand for 'everything' (e.g. every record in a table)

## A database consists of tables. Tables consist of records (~rows) and fields (~columns)
## Every field has a data type. Common data types:
## - textual:
##  - char(size) - a character string (up to 8,000 characters). The 'size' argument specifies a maximum size and also how many bytes will be used to store the value. Even if a shorter string is entered, the specified number of byes will still be used 
##  - varchar(size) - a character string (up to 8,000 characters). The 'size' argument specifies a maximum size. Is a shorter string is entered, it will use less bytes to store it
##  - text - a long character string (up to billions of characters)
## - numeric:
##  - int - an integer
##  - tinyint - a short integer (0 to 255), suitable for numerical codes. Other versions of int are available (smallint, bigint etc.)
##  - numeric(precision, scale) - a number. The 'precision' argument specifies a total maximum number of digits that will be stored (both to the left and to the right of the decimal point). The 'scale' parameter specifies a number of decimal places that will be stored. 58.145 has a precision of 5 and a scale of 3
##  - money - a monetary value
## - temporal
##  - datetime - date and time in the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format
##  - date - date in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
##  - year - date in the 'YYYY' format
##  - timestamp - a unique date and time value that will change every time a record is created or modified

## Fields and/or tables may be defined so that they contain constraints. All constraints are optional but it's strongly advised to use the PRIMARY KEY constraint
## Common constraints:
## - NOT NULL - normally, if data is inserted but no value is specified, NULL value is inserted. If this contraint is placed, an attempt to insert the NULL value will result in an error
## - DEFAULT - if data is inserted but no value is specified, the default value will be inserted
## - UNIQUE - an attempt to insert a value that already exists in the field will result in an error
## - PRIMARY KEY - a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. A table can have multiple primary keys (collectively called composite keys)
## - FOREIGN KEY - a column that is a primery key in another table
## - CHECK - followed by a logical expression (e.g. 'age int CHECK (age >= 20)'. An attempt to insert values for which the expression is false wil result in an error

# DATABASE NORMALIZATION

## A process of organizing tables and fields in databases so that its size is reduced and dependencies between fields make sense

## A database can be in one of the forms of database normalization if it matches certain criteria. The forms and the criteria are:
## - The first normal form (1NF):
##  - There are no repeating groups of data
##  - Every table has a primary key
## - The second formal form (2NF):
##  - The database is in the first normal form
##  - There are no partial dependencies of any of the fields on the primary key (partial dependency = a primary key consists of two fields and there are fields in the table that are dependent on only one of those)
## - The third normal form (3NF)
##  - The database is in the second normal form
##  - All fields are dependent on the primary key and not on some other field

## There are additional forms (up to 6NF)

## An example when the first rule of 1NF is violated:
## There is a table with customers' orders where every record is one order and there are fields 'customer name', 'customer address' etc.
## The rule is violated because if the same customer makes multiple orders, values in the 'customer name', 'customer address' fields repeat, which is unneccessary.
## The correct way would be to create two separate tables, one for data on a customer and one for data on orders

## An example when the second rule of 2NF is violated:
## There is a table with data on what customers purchased with a composite primary key consisting of 'customer ID' and 'product ID' and there are fields in the table describing only customers (e.g. 'name') and/or only products (e.g. 'brand')
## The rule is violated because such fields are partially dependent - they are dependent only on an identifier of a customer or an product but not on both
## (This table is also poorly constructed because the primary key will only remain unique if no customer ever buys the same product twice. But this has nothing to do with 2NF.)
## The correct way would be to create three separate tables, one for data on customers, one for data on products and one on data about individual purchases that includes a customer ID, a product ID and optionally other info about a purchase (e.g. time) 

## An example when the second rule of 3NF is violated:
## There is a table on customers with a primary key 'customer id' that contains fields 'zip code', 'city' and 'country'
## The rule is violated because 'city' and 'country' are dependent on 'zip'.
## The correct way would be to create two separate tables, one for data on customers that contains 'zip code' and one for zip codes that contains 'city' and 'country' and has 'zip code' as a primary key

# CREATE TABLES FROM OTHER TABLES

## create a table with unique values of family names from 'test_table1'

CREATE TABLE test_table3 AS

# INNER JOIN

## Inner join is a join where only an intersection of two tables is selected.
## This is identical to "merge" in R with the argument "all = FALSE"
## In this case, a person with id = 2 is missing because he wrote no books

select *
from test_table1, test_table2
where test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

## or

select *
from test_table1
inner join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

# LEFT JOIN

## Left join select all records in the left table and shows them together with corresponding records from the right table, even if there are no corresponding records in the right table.
## This is identical to "merge" in R with the argument "all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE"
## In this case, a person with id = 2 is present and fields for books are fileld with NULL

select *
from test_table1
left join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

# RIGHT JOIN

## Right join select all records in the right table and shows them together with corresponding records from the left table, even if there are no corresponding records in the left table.
## This is identical to "merge" in R with the argument "all.x = FALSE, all.y = TRUE"
## In this case, a person with id = 2 is missing because he wrote no books

select *
from test_table1
right join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

## A right join on users is identical to a left join on courses. The statement above is identical to this:

select *
from test_table2
left join test_table1
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

# OUTER JOIN

## The outher join only shows all records in both tables.
## This is identical to "merge" in R with the argument "all = TRUE"
## In this case, a person with id = 2 is present and fields for books are fileld with NULL

select *
from test_table1
left join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id

UNION

select *
from test_table1
right join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id;

# SELF JOIN

## Self join will join a table with itself
## It will create two temporary tables "a" and "b" that will not appear anywhere

select *
from test_table1 a, test_table1 b
where a.id = b.id;

# CARTESIAN JOIN

## Cartesian join joins two tables simply by repeating all records of the second table for the first record in the first table etc.
## No id column is specified because the tables are not actually joined by any key field

select *
from test_table1, test_table2;

# OPERATIONS WITH JOINS

## Count a number of books written by individual people

SELECT test_table1.given_name, test_table1.family_name, count(test_table2.id)
FROM test_table1
LEFT JOIN test_table2
ON test_table1.id = test_table2.id
GROUP BY test_table1.id;

# UNION

## A UNION statement will combine results of multiple SELECT statements
## If the statements produce duplicate records, it will only return those once
## To use UNION, each SELECT must have the same number of columns selected, the same number of column expressions, the same data type, and have them in the same order, but they do not have to be the same length

# UNION ALL

## A UNION ALL statement will combine results of multiple SELECT statements and will include duplicate records

# IS (NOT) NULL

## return a list of authors that wrote no books

select *
from test_table1
left join test_table2
on test_table1.id = test_table2.id
where book_id is null;

# TRANSACTIONS

## ROLLBACK reverts a database to a state before the last COMMIT

## COMMIT saves changes made to the database. At that point, it is not possible to ROLLBACK to a previous state

## SAVEPOINT creates a save point that it is possible to ROLLBACK TO

savepoint new_savepoint;

## ROLLBACK TO  revers a database to a savepoint

rollback to new_savepoint;

## RELEASE SAVEPOINT deletes a savepoint

release savepoint new_savepoint;

# USING SEQUENCES

## AUTO_INCREMENT - is a property of a table set when a table is created. When data is loaded or inserted, NULL is entered and MySQL will automatically fill in the next value in the sequence
## The AUTO_INCREMENT field must also be a key

create table test_table4(
id int primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(20)
);

insert into test_table4
values (NULL, "kamil gregor"), (NULL, "jan dvoÅÃ¡k");
